# Example Configuration Files

Here are various configuration files that get use in my setups.

## /home/username/.googlevoicephones

This sets up the phones that are in my google voice account. The numbers 
must follow the formats outlined in the example config. We can access 
the real number from our script `gv-phone.py` by calling the aliased 
names in the configuration file.

## /home/username/.proximity

This is a configuration file I use locally in conjunction with the 
script `bt-proximity-mqtt.py`. This script is called by blueproximity, 
which allows monitoring for a paired bluetooth device and running a 
script on detection. The configuration I use for blueproximity can be 
found in the file `/home/username/.blueproximity/standard.conf` within 
this directory.

### /home/username/.blueproximity/standard.conf
As mentioned above this is a configuration file generated by 
blueproximity. You can save this in your `/home/username/.blueproximity` 
directory, if you modify it, and then load it with blueproximity.
